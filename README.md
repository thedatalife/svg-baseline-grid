# svg-baseline-grid

Baseline grid overlay used for development of web projects with a strong vertical rhythm. Makes no external requests and generates the baseline grid using SVG.

## getting started

Include the baselineGrid.js file before any scripts that will need to use the functionality. The baselineGrid library will dynamically create a stylesheet and then add rules for body and body:after with a SVG encoded as the background image of the psuedo element.

```
<script src="baselineGrid.js"></script>
```

## example

See the example project for use.
